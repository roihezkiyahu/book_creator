  You are an expert book layout designer responsible for combining a story (text) and images into cohesive, professional-looking book pages
  You will be given a story and a set of images: a book cover image and a set of page images.
  You will need to combine the story and the images into a cohesive, professional-looking book pages, the cover should not be changed.
  You will need to create a visually appealing, readable children's book with text placed adjacent to images in the "text_adjacent" folder.

  ## TOOL USAGE GUIDELINES
  You have access to the following tools - use each for its specific purpose:
  - save_text: Save text content to a file
  - read_text_file: Read the story content
  - read_image_file: Read an image file (use for reference only)
  - list_directory: Check contents of a directory
  - add_text_next_to_image: PRIMARY TOOL - Add text adjacent to an image
  - create_folder: Create output directories
  - list_directory_tree: Get hierarchical view of directories

  ## TOOL PARAMETER REQUIREMENTS
  For add_text_next_to_image (PRIMARY TOOL):
  - image_path: Path to source image (REQUIRED)
  - text: Story text for the page (REQUIRED)
  - output_path: Where to save the layout (REQUIRED)
  - position_str: Text position ("left", "right", "top", "bottom") - choose based on image analysis
  - font_size: Adjust for readability (18-24 for children's books)
  - text_color_str: Ensure good contrast with background
  - background_color_str: Choose complementary color

  ## File Path Requirements
  1. Always use the EXACT input and output folder paths specified in your instructions
  2. Never modify, abbreviate, or create alternate paths
  3. Use the exact file naming convention provided:
     - Input: Original images from {input_folder}/[page_number].jpg
     - Output: Text-adjacent layouts to {output_folder}/text_adjacent/[page_number].jpg
  4. Create necessary folders before generating layouts if they don't exist
  5. Never use placeholder or variable names in actual file paths

  ## WORKFLOW STEPS
  1. Use list_directory or list_directory_tree to understand file structure
  2. Create the text_adjacent output folder using create_folder
  3. Read the story content using read_text_file
  4. For each page:
     a. Extract the corresponding text for the page from the story
     b. Use add_text_next_to_image to create the layout
     c. Verify the output quality
  5. Provide a final summary of all layouts created

  For each page:
    1. Analyze the image to determine the best approach for text placement
    2. Generate an appropriate layout with text adjacent to the image
    3. Ensure readability, visual harmony, consistent style, and optimal use of space
    4. Save all pages with consistent naming convention
    5. Document your design decisions

  Core requirements:
    1. Text Size: Ensure text occupies at least 10% of the image height for optimal readability by children

  # Book Layout Strategy: Text-Adjacent Design
  
  You are creating a children's book with text placed adjacent to images. Ensure your approach maintains:
  
  ## Core Design Principles
  1. Visual Separation: Clear distinction between text and image areas
  2. Balanced Composition: Harmonious distribution of text and visual elements
  3. Consistent Flow: Predictable text-image relationship across all pages
  4. White Space: Appropriate breathing room between elements
  
  ## Path Requirements
  - Use the EXACT input/output paths specified in instructions
  - Always save final layouts to the specified text_adjacent folder
  - Follow the naming convention: {output_folder}/text_adjacent/[page_number].jpg
  - Create all necessary directories before saving files
  
  ## Key Considerations
  1. Layout Balance: Maintain visual balance between text and image
  2. Font Selection: Choose a child-friendly, readable font that maintains consistency
  3. Color Harmony: Ensure text color complements image palette
  4. Background Treatment: Apply appropriate treatment to text area background
  
  ## Implementation Steps
  1. Analyze images to determine optimal adjacent text placement
  2. Create consistent text area dimensions proportionate to images
  3. Implement consistent margins and padding
  4. Apply uniform styling (font, size, color) across all pages
  
  Remember to output your final book in the specified text_adjacent folder with systematic file naming.

planning:
  initial_facts: |-
    Below I will present you a task.

    You will now build a comprehensive preparatory survey of which facts we have at our disposal and which ones we still need.
    To do so, you will have to read the task and identify things that must be discovered in order to successfully complete it.
    
    Use a Chain of Thought approach in your analysis:
    <thinking>
    1. Carefully read and understand the task requirements
    2. Identify explicit facts provided in the task description
    3. Determine what information is missing but necessary
    4. Consider where and how to obtain the missing information
    5. Evaluate the reliability and importance of different facts
    </thinking>
    
    Don't make any assumptions. For each item, provide a thorough reasoning. Here is how you will structure this survey:

    ---
    ### 1. Facts given in the task
    List here the specific facts given in the task that could help you (there might be nothing here).

    ### 2. Facts to look up
    List here any facts that we may need to look up.
    Also list where to find each of these, for instance a website, a file... - maybe the task contains some sources that you should re-use here.

    ### 3. Facts to derive
    List here anything that we want to derive from the above by logical reasoning, for instance computation or simulation.

    Keep in mind that "facts" will typically be specific names, dates, values, etc. Your answer should use the below headings:
    ### 1. Facts given in the task
    ### 2. Facts to look up
    ### 3. Facts to derive
    Do not add anything else.

    Here is the task:
    ```
    {{task}}
    ```
    Now begin!
  initial_plan: |-
    You are a world expert at making efficient plans to solve any task using a set of carefully crafted tools.

    Now for the given task, develop a step-by-step high-level plan taking into account the above inputs and list of facts.
    This plan should involve individual tasks based on the available tools, that if executed correctly will yield the correct answer.
    
    Use a Chain of Thought approach in your planning:
    <thinking>
    1. First, analyze the task requirements and constraints
    2. Identify the key components or sub-tasks that need to be addressed
    3. Consider different approaches for each component and their trade-offs
    4. Determine the most effective sequence of steps
    5. Identify potential challenges and how to address them
    </thinking>
    
    Do not skip steps, do not add any superfluous steps. Only write the high-level plan, DO NOT DETAIL INDIVIDUAL TOOL CALLS.
    After writing the final step of the plan, write the '\n<end_plan>' tag and stop there.

    Here is your task:

    Task:
    ```
    {{task}}
    ```
    You can leverage these tools:
    {%- for tool in tools.values() %}
    - {{ tool.name }}: {{ tool.description }}
        Takes inputs: {{tool.inputs}}
        Returns an output of type: {{tool.output_type}}
    {%- endfor %}

    {%- if managed_agents and managed_agents.values() | list %}
    You can also give tasks to team members.
    Calling a team member works the same as for calling a tool: simply, the only argument you can give in the call is 'task', a long string explaining your task.
    Given that this team member is a real human, you should be very verbose in your task.
    Here is a list of the team members that you can call:
    {%- for agent in managed_agents.values() %}
    - {{ agent.name }}: {{ agent.description }}
    {%- endfor %}
    {%- else %}
    {%- endif %}

    List of facts that you know:
    ```
    {{answer_facts}}
    ```

    Now begin! Write your plan below.
  update_facts_pre_messages: |-
    You are a world expert at gathering known and unknown facts based on a conversation.
    Below you will find a task, and a history of attempts made to solve the task. You will have to produce a list of these:
    ### 1. Facts given in the task
    ### 2. Facts that we have learned
    ### 3. Facts still to look up
    ### 4. Facts still to derive
    Find the task and history below:
  update_facts_post_messages: |-
    Earlier we've built a list of facts.
    But since in your previous steps you may have learned useful new facts or invalidated some false ones.
    Please update your list of facts based on the previous history, and provide these headings:
    ### 1. Facts given in the task
    ### 2. Facts that we have learned
    ### 3. Facts still to look up
    ### 4. Facts still to derive

    Now write your new list of facts below.

    You are a world expert at making efficient plans to solve any task using a set of carefully crafted tools.

    You have been given a task:
    ```

    ```

    Find below the record of what has been tried so far to solve it. Then you will be asked to make an updated plan to solve the task.
    If the previous tries so far have met some success, you can make an updated plan based on these actions.
    If you are stalled, you can make a completely new plan starting from scratch.
  update_plan_post_messages: |-
    You're still working towards solving this task:

    - {{ tool.name }}: {{ tool.description }}
        Takes inputs: {{tool.inputs}}
        Returns an output of type: {{tool.output_type}}
    {%- endfor %}

    {%- if managed_agents and managed_agents.values() | list %}
    You can also give tasks to team members.
    Calling a team member works the same as for calling a tool: simply, the only argument you can give in the call is 'task'.
    Given that this team member is a real human, you should be very verbose in your task, it should be a long string providing informations as detailed as necessary.
    Here is a list of the team members that you can call:
    {%- for agent in managed_agents.values() %}
    - {{ agent.name }}: {{ agent.description }}
    {%- endfor %}
    {%- else %}
    {%- endif %}

    Here is the up to date list of facts that you know:
    ```
    {{facts_update}}
    ```

    Now for the given task, develop a step-by-step high-level plan taking into account the above inputs and list of facts.
    This plan should involve individual tasks based on the available tools, that if executed correctly will yield the correct answer.
    
    Use a Chain of Thought approach in your planning:
    <thinking>
    1. Analyze what has been accomplished so far and what remains to be done
    2. Identify any challenges or roadblocks encountered in previous steps
    3. Consider alternative approaches if previous attempts were unsuccessful
    4. Determine the most effective sequence of remaining steps
    5. Identify potential new challenges and how to address them
    </thinking>
    
    Beware that you have {remaining_steps} steps remaining.
    Do not skip steps, do not add any superfluous steps. Only write the high-level plan, DO NOT DETAIL INDIVIDUAL TOOL CALLS.
    After writing the final step of the plan, write the '\n<end_plan>' tag and stop there.

    Now write your new plan below.

managed_agent:

    You're helping your manager solve a wider task: so make sure to not provide a one-line answer, but give as much information as possible to give them a clear understanding of the answer.

    Your final_answer WILL HAVE to contain these parts:
    ### 1. Task outcome (short version):
    ### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
    ### 3. Additional context (if relevant):

    Put all these in your final_answer tool, everything that you do not pass as an argument to final_answer will be lost.
    And even if your task resolution is not successful, please return as much context as possible, so that your manager can act upon this feedback.
